<p>
Exet is free, open source software for setting crosswords.
You can use Exet from my site, <a target="_blank"
  href="https://exet.app">exet.app</a> or you can download and use your own
copy of the software from the
<a target="_blank"
  href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exet">Exet GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
Exet comes with a permissive MIT license. The full license notice is provided
at the bottom of this page.
</p>

<p>
Exet has no library/package/software dependencies. You should be able to use
it from any modern browser. The experience may not be great on smaller screens
like phones, though.
</p>

<p>
Exet saves all revisions of all crosswords that you work on, in the browser's
local storage.  Exet never sends your crosswords to wherever it is getting
served from.
</p>

<p>
You can download the crosswords that you create with Exet in the
<a target="_blank"
  href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exolve">Exolve</a> format
or in the .puz format.
You can also grab embeddable HTML code for adding your crossword to any web
site or blog, using Exolve (but see the
<a target="_blank"
  href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exolve#exolve-widget">known caveats
in the Exolve documentation</a>).
</p>

<p>
As of May 2023, Exet supports English, Portuguese (BRazilian), and
Hindi (I'll add support for more languages over time).
</p>

<p>
I welcome <a target="_blank"
  href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exet/issues/new">bug
  reports, feature requests, useful links to add</a>.
You may
<a href="mailto:ideas@exet.app" target="_blank">contact me via email too</a>.
</p>
There's also a discussion group for users:

<h3>UKACD18</h3>

<p>
The lexicon used by Exet for providing grid-fill suggestions is a modified
version of the "UKACD" words list, which comes with its own copyight notice
that is reproduced below. I made the following modifications to the UKACD words
list:
<ul>
  <li>Removed a few swear words.</li>
  <li>Replaced all accented characters with non-accented ones.</li>
  <li>Deleted all punctuation characters other than spaces, hyphens,
      and apostrophes.</li>
  <li>Attached a popularity score to each word/phrase using a dump of all of
      Wikipedia's English-language articles.</li>
  <li>Created an index of the lexicon suitable for use by my JavaScript
      code. Source code for the last two steps is available in my
      <a target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/lufz">Lufz GitHub
        repository</a>.</li>

</ul>

fact, we expect a number of errors, omissions and inconsistencies to
remain in the dictionary. We intend to continually update the
dictionary by correction existing entries and by adding new ones. From
time to time a new major version will be released.

We welcome input from users: Please send email to Alex Rudnicky

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The current version of cmudict is now cmudict-0.7b
[First released November 19, 2014]

Note that the first '.' in the file name has changed to a '-' as it
was observed that file systems occasionally get confused about the
scope of the extension.

errors are incorporate new words. If you require a unique version, be
sure to specify a revision when you check it out.

cmudict-0.7b includes various systematic fixes and additional words.
